# Alloyed Data Science Challenge

Normally, I develop machine learning projects with Python scripts with automatic documentation and testing and use Jupyter Notebook only for visualisations. Here, I only used one notebook to make it easier to look at everything I have done.

The `predict_density.ipynb` notebook contains the following:
- Development of a machine learning model to predict the density of additively manufactured parts.
- Comments on how I selected features and the model, measured the performance, regularised, quantified uncertainty, and mitigated effects of sparse datasets.

The packages that I used are provided in the 'requirements.txt' file.
